**Bitcoin** was the first blockchain. It works as a ledger and was introduced as a secure financial system.\
But, it had limitations.

Ethereum is a Core Blockchain
More Tokens can be built on Ethereum Blockchain such as:

- Polygon $MATIC
- Optimism $OP
- ImmutableX IMX

They are basically smart contracts written on ethereum blockchain.

Bank provides its APIs to only reliable platforms such as RazorPay, Stripe
Which can be used to make transaction on other third party platforms such as crypto exchange.

**Decentralized Exchange:**
A contract that lets us exchange fiat for token, token for token, and token for fiat.
